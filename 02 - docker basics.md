**Objective:** Gain foundational knowledge and hands-on experience with Docker, a containerization platform.

**Task Description:**

**1. Install Docker:**
   - Install Docker on your local machine. Provide the steps and commands for installing Docker on your specific operating system.

**2. Run Your First Container:**
   - Pull a basic Docker image from the Docker Hub (e.g., the official Ubuntu image).
   - Run a container based on the pulled image.
   - Verify that the container is running and access its shell.

**3. Build a Docker Image:**
   - Create a simple web application or choose an existing one.
   - Write a Dockerfile to define the image for your application.
   - Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.

**4. Docker Compose:**
   - Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define a multi-container application.
   - Include at least two services, such as a web application and a database.
   - Use Docker Compose to start the multi-container application.

**5. Volume Mounting:**
   - Create a Docker volume.
   - Modify your web application or container to write data to this volume.
   - Demonstrate how the data persists even if the container is stopped and restarted.

**6. Networking:**
   - Create a bridge network in Docker.
   - Run two containers on the same network and demonstrate that they can communicate with each other.

**7. Cleanup:**
   - Show how to list and remove Docker containers, images, and volumes.
   - Clean up all resources created during the tasks.

**Submission:**
   - Provide a document or a series of commands/scripts illustrating the steps you took to complete each task.
   - Include screenshots or outputs where necessary to demonstrate the successful completion of each task.
   - Write a brief summary of your experience and any challenges you encountered.

**Notes:**
   - Ensure that you document the version of Docker you are using.
   - Feel free to explore additional Docker features beyond the basic tasks if you have time and interest.
   - Use online resources and the official Docker documentation if you need assistance.
