Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide for the beginner DevOps task you described:

### Task: Setting up a DevOps Environment with Vagrant and Docker

#### Prerequisites:
- Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

#### Steps:

1. **Create a Vagrantfile**:
   - Create a directory for your project and navigate into it.
   - Create a `Vagrantfile` with the following content:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-20.04"
  
  config.vm.define "vm1" do |vm1|
    vm1.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
    vm1.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.name = "vm1"
    end
    vm1.vm.provision "shell", path: "bootstrap.sh"
  end

  config.vm.define "vm2" do |vm2|
    vm2.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.11"
    vm2.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.name = "vm2"
    end
    vm2.vm.provision "shell", path: "bootstrap.sh"
  end
end
```

2. **Create provisioning scripts**:
   - Create `bootstrap` scripts in the same directory as your `Vagrantfile`.

`bootstrap.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker vagrant
```

3. **Start VMs**:
   - In your terminal, run `vagrant up` to start the VMs.

4. **Expose Docker Socket on VM1 and Connect from VM2**:
   - SSH into VM1 with `vagrant ssh vm1`.
   - Modify Docker service to listen on a TCP socket. Edit the Docker daemon configuration file, usually located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "hosts": ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]
   }
   ```

   > The above configuration tells Docker to listen on both the Unix socket and on all available network interfaces on port 2375.

   - Restart Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

   - SSH into VM1 with `vagrant ssh vm2`.
   - Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to the IP address of VM1 and the port you specified in the Docker daemon configuration (`2375` in this example).

   ```bash
   export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.33.10:2375
   ```

   - Test Docker connection. Run a Docker command on VM2 to test the connection to VM1:

   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

   > If everything is set up correctly, this command should display information about the Docker daemon running on VM1.

   > Remember that exposing the Docker socket in this way is insecure and should be done only in a trusted network environment or for temporary, controlled situations. In a production environment, it's recommended to use secure communication methods, such as TLS, and implement proper access controls.

5. **Deploy Simple Application on VM2**:
   - On VM2, create a directory `nginx_config` with your desired Nginx configuration files and a directory `data` with your static web page content.

6. **Start Nginx Container on VM2**:
   - On VM2, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name mynginx -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/nginx_config:/etc/nginx/conf.d -v $(pwd)/data:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

7. **View Static Web Page**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://192.168.33.11` to view your static web page.

Congratulations! You've completed the beginner DevOps task. This setup includes two VMs, Docker installation, Docker socket exposure on VM1, connection from VM2, and deployment of a simple Nginx application with configuration and static content volumes.
